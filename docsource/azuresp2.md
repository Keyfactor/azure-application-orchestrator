## Overview

The Azure Enterprise Application/Service Principal certificate operations are implemented by the `AzureSP` store type, and supports the management of a single certificate for use in SSO/SAML assertion signing. The Management Add operation is only supported with the certificate replacement option, since adding a new certificate will replace the existing certificate. The Add operation will also set newly added certificates as the active certificate for SSO/SAML usage. The Management Remove operation removes the certificate from the Enterprise Application/Service Principal, which is the same as removing the SSO/SAML signing certificate. The Discovery operation discovers all Enterprise Applications/Service Principals in the tenant.

## Requirements

Service Principal certificates are typically used for SAML Token signing. Service Principals are created from Enterprise Applications, and will mostly be configured with a variation of Microsoft's [SAML-based single sign-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal) documentation.
