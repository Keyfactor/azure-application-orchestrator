# Overview

The Azure Enterprise Application/Service Principal certificate operations are implemented by the `AzureSP` store type, and supports the management of a single certificate for use in SSO/SAML assertion signing. The Management Add operation is only supported with the certificate replacement option, since adding a new certificate will replace the existing certificate. The Add operation will also set newly added certificates as the active certificate for SSO/SAML usage. The Management Remove operation removes the certificate from the Enterprise Application/Service Principal, which is the same as removing the SSO/SAML signing certificate. The Discovery operation discovers all Enterprise Applications/Service Principals in the tenant.


# Requirements

### Azure Service Principal (Graph API Authentication)

The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension uses an [Azure Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser) for authentication. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a service principal. Currently, Client Secret authentication is supported. The Service Principal must have the following API Permission:
- **_Microsoft Graph Application Permissions_**:
  - `Application.ReadWrite.All` (_not_ Delegated; Admin Consent) - Allows the app to create, read, update and delete applications and service principals without a signed-in user.

> For more information on Admin Consent for App-only access (also called "Application Permissions"), see the [primer on application-only access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-only-access-primer).

Alternatively, the Service Principal can be granted the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` permission if the Service Principal is only intended to manage its own App Registration/Application.

#### Client Certificate or Client Secret

Beginning in version 3.0.0, the Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension supports both [client certificate authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) and [client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-2-add-a-client-secret) authentication.

* **Client Secret** - Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-2-add-a-client-secret) to create a Client Secret. This secret will be used as the **Server Password** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.
* **Client Certificate** - Create a client certificate key pair with the Client Authentication extended key usage. The client certificate will be used in the ClientCertificate field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section. If you have access to Keyfactor Command, the instructions in this section walk you through enrolling a certificate and ensuring that it's in the correct format. Once enrolled, follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) to add the _public key_ certificate (no private key) to the service principal used for authentication.

    The certificate can be in either of the following formats:
    * Base64-encoded PKCS#12 (PFX) with a matching private key.
    * Base64-encoded PEM-encoded certificate _and_ PEM-encoded PKCS8 private key. Make sure that the certificate and private key are separated with a newline. The order doesn't matter - the extension will determine which is which.

    If the private key is encrypted, the encryption password will replace the **Server Password** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.

> **Creating and Formatting a Client Certificate using Keyfactor Command**
>
> To get started quickly, you can follow the instructions below to create and properly format a client certificate to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API.
>
> 1. In Keyfactor Command, hover over **Enrollment** and select **PFX Enrollment**.
> 2. Select a **Template** that supports Client Authentication as an extended key usage.
> 3. Populate the certificate subject as appropriate for the Template. It may be sufficient to only populate the Common Name, but consult your IT policy to ensure that this certificate is compliant.
> 4. At the bottom of the page, uncheck the box for **Include Chain**, and select either **PFX** or **PEM** as the certificate Format.
> 5. Make a note of the password on the next page - it won't be shown again.
> 6. Prepare the certificate and private key for Azure and the Orchestrator extension:
>     * If you downloaded the certificate in PEM format, use the commands below:
>
>        ```shell
>        # Verify that the certificate downloaded from Command contains the certificate and private key. They should be in the same file
>        cat <your_certificate.pem>
>
>        # Separate the certificate from the private key
>        openssl x509 -in <your_certificate.pem> -out pubkeycert.pem
>
>        # Base64 encode the certificate and private key
>        cat <your_certificate.pem> | base64 > clientcertkeypair.pem.base64
>        ```
>
>    * If you downloaded the certificate in PFX format, use the commands below:
>
>        ```shell
>        # Export the certificate from the PFX file
>        openssl pkcs12 -in <your_certificate.pfx> -clcerts -nokeys -out pubkeycert.pem
>
>        # Base64 encode the PFX file
>        cat <your_certificate.pfx> | base64 > clientcert.pfx.base64
>        ```
> 7. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) to add the public key certificate to the service principal used for authentication.
>
> You will use `clientcert.[pem|pfx].base64` as the **ClientCertificate** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.

### Enterprise Application (Service Principal)

#### Service Principal Certificates

Service Principal certificates are typically used for SAML Token signing. Service Principals are created from Enterprise Applications, and will mostly be configured with a variation of Microsoft's [SAML-based single sign-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal) documentation. For more information on the mechanics of the Service Principal certificate management capabilities of this extension, please see the [mechanics](#extension-mechanics) section.

# Extension Mechanics

The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension uses the [Microsoft Dotnet Graph SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview) to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. The extension uses the following Graph API endpoints to manage Service Principal certificates:

* [Get Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/serviceprincipal-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) - Used to obtain the Object ID of the Enterprise Application, and to download the certificates owned by the Service Principal.
* [Update Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/serviceprincipal-update?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) - Used to modify the Enterprise Application to add or remove certificates.
    * Specifically, the extension manipulates the [`keyCredentials` resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/keycredential?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the Service Principal object.

### Discovery Job

The Discovery operation discovers all Azure Enterprise Applications that the Service Principal has access to. The discovered Enterprise Applications (specifically, their Application IDs) are reported back to Command and can be easily added as certificate stores from the Locations tab.

The Discovery operation uses the "Directories to search" field, and accepts input in one of the following formats:
- `*` - If the asterisk symbol `*` is used, the extension will search for all Azure Enterprise Applications that the Service Principal has access to, but only in the tenant that the discovery job was configured for as specified by the "Client Machine" field in the certificate store configuration.
- `<tenant-id>,<tenant-id>,...` - If a comma-separated list of tenant IDs is used, the extension will search for all Azure Enterprise Applications available in each tenant specified in the list. The tenant IDs should be the GUIDs associated with each tenant, and it's the user's responsibility to ensure that the service principal has access to the specified tenants.

> The Discovery Job only supports Client Secret authentication.
