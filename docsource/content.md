## Overview

The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension remotely manages both Azure [App Registration/Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/certificate-credentials) certificates and [Enterprise Application/Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/enterprise-apps-certificate-credentials) certificates. Application certificates are typically public key only and used for client certificate authentication, while Service Principal certificates are commonly used for [SAML Assertion signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on). The extension implements the Inventory, Management Add, Management Remove, and Discovery job types.

Certificates used for client authentication by Applications (configured in App Registrations) are represented by the [`AzureApp` store type](docs/azureapp.md), and certificates used for SSO/SAML assertion signing are represented by the [`AzureSP` store type](docs/azuresp.md). Both store types are managed by the same extension. The extension is configured with a single Azure Service Principal that is used to authenticate to the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api). The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension manages certificates for Azure App Registrations (Applications) and Enterprise Applications (Service Principals) differently.
