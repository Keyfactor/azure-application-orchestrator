## Overview

The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension remotely manages both Azure [App Registration/Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/certificate-credentials) certificates and [Enterprise Application/Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/enterprise-apps-certificate-credentials) certificates. Application certificates are typically public key only and used for client certificate authentication, while Service Principal certificates are commonly used for [SAML Assertion signing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/tutorial-manage-certificates-for-federated-single-sign-on). The extension implements the Inventory, Management Add, Management Remove, and Discovery job types.

Certificates used for client authentication by Applications (configured in App Registrations) are represented by the [`AzureApp` store type](docs/azureapp.md), and certificates used for SSO/SAML assertion signing are represented by the [`AzureSP` store type](docs/azuresp.md). Both store types are managed by the same extension. The extension is configured with a single Azure Service Principal that is used to authenticate to the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api). The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension manages certificates for Azure App Registrations (Applications) and Enterprise Applications (Service Principals) differently. 

## Requirements

### Azure Service Principal (Graph API Authentication)

The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension uses an [Azure Service Principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser) for authentication. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a service principal. Currently, both Client Secret authentication and Client Certificate authentication (mTLS) are supported. 

The Service Principal must have the following API Permission:
- **_Microsoft Graph Application Permissions_**:
  - `Application.ReadWrite.All` (_not_ Delegated; Admin Consent) - Allows the app to create, read, update and delete applications and service principals without a signed-in user.

> For more information on Admin Consent for App-only access (also called "Application Permissions"), see the [primer on application-only access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-only-access-primer).

Alternatively, the Service Principal can be granted the `Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` permission if the Service Principal is only intended to manage its own App Registration/Application.

#### Client Certificate or Client Secret

Beginning in version 3.0.0, the Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension supports both [client certificate authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) and [client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-2-add-a-client-secret) authentication.

* **Client Secret** - Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-2-add-a-client-secret) to create a Client Secret. This secret will be used as the **Server Password** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.
* **Client Certificate** - Create a client certificate key pair with the Client Authentication extended key usage. The client certificate will be used in the ClientCertificate field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section. If you have access to Keyfactor Command, the instructions in this section walk you through enrolling a certificate and ensuring that it's in the correct format. Once enrolled, follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) to add the _public key_ certificate (no private key) to the service principal used for authentication.

    The certificate can be in either of the following formats:
    * Base64-encoded PKCS#12 (PFX) with a matching private key.
    * Base64-encoded PEM-encoded certificate _and_ PEM-encoded PKCS8 private key. Make sure that the certificate and private key are separated with a newline. The order doesn't matter - the extension will determine which is which.

    If the private key is encrypted, the encryption password will replace the **Server Password** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section.

> **Creating and Formatting a Client Certificate using Keyfactor Command**
>
> To get started quickly, you can follow the instructions below to create and properly format a client certificate to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API.
>
> 1. In Keyfactor Command, hover over **Enrollment** and select **PFX Enrollment**.
> 2. Select a **Template** that supports Client Authentication as an extended key usage.
> 3. Populate the certificate subject as appropriate for the Template. It may be sufficient to only populate the Common Name, but consult your IT policy to ensure that this certificate is compliant.
> 4. At the bottom of the page, uncheck the box for **Include Chain**, and select either **PFX** or **PEM** as the certificate Format.
> 5. Make a note of the password on the next page - it won't be shown again.
> 6. Prepare the certificate and private key for Azure and the Orchestrator extension:
>     * If you downloaded the certificate in PEM format, use the commands below:
>
>        ```shell
>        # Verify that the certificate downloaded from Command contains the certificate and private key. They should be in the same file
>        cat <your_certificate.pem>
>
>        # Separate the certificate from the private key
>        openssl x509 -in <your_certificate.pem> -out pubkeycert.pem
>
>        # Base64 encode the certificate and private key
>        cat <your_certificate.pem> | base64 > clientcertkeypair.pem.base64
>        ```
>
>    * If you downloaded the certificate in PFX format, use the commands below:
>
>        ```shell
>        # Export the certificate from the PFX file
>        openssl pkcs12 -in <your_certificate.pfx> -clcerts -nokeys -out pubkeycert.pem
>
>        # Base64 encode the PFX file
>        cat <your_certificate.pfx> | base64 > clientcert.pfx.base64
>        ```
> 7. Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2#option-1-add-a-certificate) to add the public key certificate to the service principal used for authentication.
>
> You will use `clientcert.[pem|pfx].base64` as the **ClientCertificate** field in the [Certificate Store Configuration](#certificate-store-configuration) section. 

## Discovery

> The Discovery Job for all four Certificate Store Types implemented by the Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension returns Store Paths in the format `<guid> (<friendly name>)`. When defining Certificate Stores manually, you may elect to follow this format, or use the standard `<guid>` for the Store Path.

## Extension Mechanics

The Azure App Registration and Enterprise Application Orchestrator extension uses the [Microsoft Dotnet Graph SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/sdks-overview) to interact with the Microsoft Graph API. The extension uses the following Graph API endpoints to manage Application certificates:

* [Get Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-get?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) - Used to obtain the Object ID of the App Registration, and to download the certificates owned by the App Registration.
* [Update Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-update?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http) - Used to modify the App Registration to add or remove certificates.
    * Specifically, the extension manipulates the [`keyCredentials` resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/keycredential?view=graph-rest-1.0) of the Application object.
